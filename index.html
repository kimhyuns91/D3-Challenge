          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Scatter plot between the two data variables are shown to find  health risks facing particular demographics among United States. 
            
            For this Analysis, 2014 data is grabbed from  information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. </p>

          <p>As expected poverty and lack of healthcare was directly related and householf income was indirectly related to lack of healthcare.
            Essentially, people who made less money and were not on nutrious diet were lacking healthcare. The trend is most likely from the annual fee for healthcare.
            Household with lower income most likely do not have enough money to support good healthcare for all household members.
          </p>

          <p>Odd trend comes from obesity vs income. It's indirectly correlated, where less income had higher obesity rate. One reason I can deduce is that, lower income households
            are eating more less healthy food, i.e. fast food. Eating junk food at higher frequency would have caused weight to increase significantly.
